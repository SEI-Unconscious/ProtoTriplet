# ProtoTriplet: Cross-Receiver Few-Shot Specific Emitter Identification

***This repository provides the official implementation for the paper "ProtoTriplet: Cross-Receiver Few-Shot Specific Emitter Identification via Prototype-Level Contrastive Adaptation". The code is currently provided for peer-review purposes to ensure reproducibility.***

## 📌 Overview

Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) remains a challenge when dealing with varying receiver characteristics and limited labeled samples. **ProtoTriplet** addresses these issues by leveraging a prototypical triplet loss structure to learn robust, device-specific features that generalize across different reception hardware.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Cross-Receiver Robustness**: Designed to mitigate hardware bias between different receivers.
* **Few-Shot Learning**: Achieves high identification accuracy with minimal training samples per class.
* **Efficient Implementation**: Based on Python, utilizing specialized data structures for signal processing.

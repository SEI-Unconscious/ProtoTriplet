# ProtoTriplet: Cross-Receiver Few-Shot Specific Emitter Identification

***This repository is currently under double-blind peer review. For the integrity of the process, please do not disclose author identity.***

This repository contains the official implementation of the **ProtoTriplet** method for Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) in cross-receiver and few-shot scenarios.

## 📌 Overview

Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) remains a challenge when dealing with varying receiver characteristics and limited labeled samples. **ProtoTriplet** addresses these issues by leveraging a prototypical triplet loss structure to learn robust, device-specific features that generalize across different reception hardware.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Cross-Receiver Robustness**: Designed to mitigate hardware bias between different receivers.
* **Few-Shot Learning**: Achieves high identification accuracy with minimal training samples per class.
* **Efficient Implementation**: Based on Python, utilizing specialized data structures for signal processing.
